## Old Assignment Remastered

This program is an old assignment quiz for Pok√©mon LGPE.

I am taking an old Python assignment from when I started learning Python, and using what I've learned since then to make the code more efficient, but still doing mostly the same thing.

Also, I know that it says "Let's GO, Eevee! Quiz," but that's just because it's the version that I have. It counts for all of LGPE.

### Key

`Old.py` is the old assignment, exactly how it was when I submitted it in 2019.

`New.py` is the new version.

---

### Features of the new version

- Allows for easily adding new questions. This is just a side effect of my compact code.
- Made to support Windows, Linux, macOS, and Java (I think) to the best of my abilities. Thought it would be fun to implement. It was.
- More compact that the original.
